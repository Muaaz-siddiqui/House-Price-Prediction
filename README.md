🏡 House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

This is a simple machine learning project where I used Linear Regression to predict house prices.
I built it as part of my learning journey to understand how regression models work, how to evaluate them, and how to visualize the results.

📊 Results

R² Score: 0.66

RMSE: 0.207

MAE: 0.043

These results show that the model is doing a decent job, though there’s still room for improvement.
Since this project is mainly for learning, I focused on understanding the process rather than getting the “perfect” accuracy.

📷 Visualization

The project includes a scatter plot of Predicted vs Actual prices.
The red dashed line shows the “perfect predictions,” and the blue points are my model’s predictions.
(I’ll add the actual plot image here later.)
